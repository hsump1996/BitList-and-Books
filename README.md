Create a new series of bits from a string that represents a binary number:

-the string only consist of 0's and 1's
-if it does not, raise a ValueError with a message stating that only 0 and 1 are allowed in the string
-if the string entered is valid, find some way to retain the bits
-saved the data entered on self (that is, keep an internal representation of the data for each instance)
