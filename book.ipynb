In order to test this out, I initialized two strings at the beginning: \"Jekyll\" and \"Hyde\". In addition, I initialized dictionary. As I read each line of the txt file, I first stripped the line to remove any unnecessay space or newline. Then, I created a list of words in that particular line to examine. I then looped through the newly created list of words. Here, I checked for few things. I first checked whether the dictionary currently contains the strings \"Jekyll\" and \"Hyde\". If the dictionary did not contain the words, I initialized the values of each key(word) to 1. If the dictionary did contain the words, then I simply increased the values of each key(Jekyll and Hyde) by 1. Finally, I looped through the keys of the dictionary, and printed the keys and values of the dictionary. My hypothesis was the word \"Hyde\" appears more often in the book. In fact, my hypothesis was correct.\n",
